# Coffee-shop-analysis

**Introduction**


I was provided with daily sales report of a Coffee shop, which also sell other sweets and savouries. Before merging all 30 files, I did some cleaning in excel and also added date column for convenience.

**Data set**


The dataset used was daily sales report for September 2023. I am not allowed to share the data hence, can't upload it.

**Aim and methodology**


The aim of this analysis is to explore these questions:
1. What are the most popular products that were sold in the month
  - After reading, merging, cleaning and adding time related columns I calculated total sales for each category and plotted it as well. [01](https://github.com/smahi3003/Coffee-shop-analysis/blob/main/NBS/01_Bath_Nataco_Sales_Analysis.ipynb)

2. For further analysis I chose top 4 most selling items and explored trends and patterns in those, so the first one is original natas.
  - All the findings and insights of original natas sales can be found here [02](https://github.com/smahi3003/Coffee-shop-analysis/blob/main/NBS/02_Normal_Nata_Analysis.ipynb) I categorise the number of natas units sold on "Day of the week" and "Week number"

3. Second most popular item is coffee deals
  - Explored coffee deals on different time columns and also further explored different categories of coffees and thier trends and patterns. Jupyter notebook can be found here [03](https://github.com/smahi3003/Coffee-shop-analysis/blob/main/NBS/03_Coffee_Deal_Analysis.ipynb)

4. Another one of the most popular items are flavored natas
  - So I explored the different flavors and visualised trends and patterns on week days and week number, notebook for that is here [04](https://github.com/smahi3003/Coffee-shop-analysis/blob/main/NBS/04_Flavour_Nata_Analysis.ipynb)

5. One of the top 4 items are savouries but there are 11 different kinds.
  - The code with summary can be foun here [05](https://github.com/smahi3003/Coffee-shop-analysis/blob/main/NBS/05_Savouries_Analysis.ipynb)
